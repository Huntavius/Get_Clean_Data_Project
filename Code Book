This is the code book for run.analysis.R

1.  act_dat_testx = the "test" data set, one of the two data sets to be combined.
2.  act_dat_testy = a number for each observation of the test set coresponding to one of 6 activity labels. (listed below under "act_activity")
3.  act_dat_trainx = the "train" data set, one of the two data sets to be combined.
4.  act_dat_trainy = a number for each observation of the train set coresponding to one of 6 activity labels. (listed below under "act_activity")
5.  act_features_total = a set of variables (listed below) estimated for accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals
        mean(): Mean value
        std(): Standard deviation
        mad(): Median absolute deviation 
        max(): Largest value in array
        min(): Smallest value in array
        sma(): Signal magnitude area
        energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
        iqr(): Interquartile range 
        entropy(): Signal entropy
        arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
        correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
        maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
        meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
        skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
        kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
        bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
        angle(): Angle between to vectors.
6.  act_activity = labels for activities completed by test subjects (below) 
        1.  WALKING
        2.  WALKING_UPSTAIRS
        3.  WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
        4.  SITTING
        5.  STANDING
        6.  LAYING
7.  act_testsub = a number for each test subject in the "test" data set.
8.  act_trainsub = a number for each test subject in the "train" data set.
